Display a set of badges based on files in a directory off the root of the blog.

== Description ==
Display "Badges" (which are really no more than HTML snippets) from a set of files in a specified directory off the root of the blog. The directory will default to "./badges" and the Zip file contains both that directory as well as a "Sample" badge.

Using the Widget you can choose whether to:

1. enable "Display Badge in a Box" (enabled by default, uses internal CSS)
2. enable "Display a Drop-Shadow" (probably best used with "Box Mode")

as well as

1. decide whether you would like to use a Title
2. define the directory of the badges.

== Installation ==

**Install**

1. Unzip the `badges.zip` file.
2. Upload `badges.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Use the "Badges" widget.

**Upgrade**

1. Follow your normal installation process
2. Open the Widget Control Panel for "Badges" and confirm settings.
3. Sit back and enjoy...

**Use the WordPress Plug-in System**

1. Select "Upgrade and Activate"
2. Congratulate yourself on a sterling job.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which naming convention is used for the badges =

All badges needs to be named `XXname.inc`, where "XX" is a number (used to determine ordering) and the ".inc" is required.

= What is the format of the "Badge" files? =

You could view the included "demo" file: `00testbadge.inc`, but here's another, slightly simpler, example:

    <!-- Support CC -->
    <div id="badge-supportcc-inner" onclick="location.href='http://creativecommons.org';" style="cursor: pointer;">
    <img width=88 height=31 alt="http://creativecommons.org" title="Support the Creative Commons!"
        src="http://creativecommons.org/images/support/2010/cc-support.png" />
    <br />
        Support the Creative Commons!
    </div>
    <!-- /Support CC -->

= How do I style the badges using CSS? =

Quite simply by using the `div.badgegroup` class to style a set of badges. To style them individually, use the `div.badge` class.

= How do I limit the styling to a set of badges? =

Look for the relevant "Badge Group's" ID and then use the `div#badge-ID > div.badge` CSS selector.

= How do I style a single badge? =

Easiest yet: every badge gets a unique ID generated by the plug-in based on the badge's file-name and the directory. Simply use that (you'll have to inspect the source to see what the id is; by example the ID generated by my Site-Licence badge is "badge-damn-licencing-licencing").

== Screenshots ==

1. Configuring the widget to read badges from `damn-badges` and display them as "Badges".
2. The default configuration of the widget, displaying the default path (badges).
3. Badges displayed Padded and Boxed, but with Drop-Shadows disabled.
